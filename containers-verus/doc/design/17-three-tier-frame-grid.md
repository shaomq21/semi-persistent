# The Three-Tier Frame Grid

This chapter is the visual proof model for Trail, Hot, and Cold history. It is
normative for frame-reconstruction arguments: vector indices run horizontally,
frame age runs vertically, and every frame owns an independent `saved_len`.
Adjacent saved lengths are not monotone; restoration may grow or shrink the live
vector.

## 1. The complete stack

The newest frame is nearest the live vector. The oldest retained frame is at the
bottom. Physical tier order is Cold | Hot | Trail.

                                  OLDEST RETAINED FRAME

C = physically covered; I = inherited from the newer layer;
· = outside this row's saved/live domain.
```

The cells marked `I` require equality to the newer snapshot's cell (or the
current live cell for F₅). Each `C` stores this frame's snapshot value, using
the oldest chronological entry in a Trail column. Captures from distinct
frames need not have equal values. This is an index-domain diagram: it does
not prescribe the physical order of Hot entries in memory.

The mandatory coverage where a frame extends beyond its newer layer is:

- F₅: columns 4 and 5, because the live length is 4;
- F₃: columns 3 through 6, because F₄'s saved length is 3;
- F₁: columns 4 through 7, because F₂'s saved length is 4.

The illustrated Cold runs are `[0, 3)` and `[4, 8)` for F₁, and `[1, 5)`
for F₀. Trail cells may contain several entries stacked vertically; section 4
shows their replay order.

Empty frames retain a delimiter and `saved_len` even when they contain no
physical entries. The delimiter is logical token identity and must survive
conversion.

### Physical authority

The proofs read the frame grid from the tier pools and nothing else: the
`hot_value_pool`, the `trail_value_pool` and the Cold runs are the physical
authority for what a frame captured, and every capture extent, every
reconstruction and every restore is justified from them. The former inert compatibility `diff_log` field and its proof scaffolding
were removed in `47722b0`; no shadow runtime log remains. Each Trail, Hot and
Cold frame owns its own `saved_len`; nothing relates a frame's saved length to
its neighbours' (§2), and a Hot frame's payload count is bounded by that
saved length while an undeduplicated Trail frame's is not, because duplicate
writes stack vertically (§8). Persistent Hot frames are unique but unordered;
sorting happens only as a transient local step inside the Hot-to-Cold
translation (§4).

## 2. Saved lengths zigzag

Each frame records the exact live length at its mark:

```text
frame:       F₀   F₁   F₂   F₃   F₄   F₅   live
saved_len:    5    8    4    7    3    6      4
               ↗    ↘    ↗    ↘    ↗    ↘
```

No proof may assume `saved_len(f) <= saved_len(f + 1)` or the reverse. The only
valid relation is pointwise coverage against `layer_above_at(f)`, which is
`snapshot[f + 1]` for an inner frame and the current view for the newest frame.

## 3. The per-cell inductive rule

For every frame `f` and every `j < saved_len(f)`:

```text
                         cell (f, j)
                              │
                ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
                │                           │
          covered by frame            not covered
                │                           │
      frame stores snapshot[f][j]     j < layer_above(f).len
                                            &&
                                      layer_above(f)[j]
                                         == snapshot[f][j]
```

The specification is:

```text
j < saved_len(f)
    ==>
    covered(f, j)
        ? stored_value(f, j) == snapshot[f][j]
        : j < layer_above(f).len
          && layer_above(f)[j] == snapshot[f][j]
```

This is `frame_cell_inv` for Trail/Hot ranges and the equivalent uncovered-cell
clause in `cold_reconstructs`.

### A frame larger than its layer above

```text
frame f saved_len = 7:       0  1  2  3  4  5  6
layer above length = 4:      ✓  ✓  ✓  ✓  ×  ×  ×
required physical coverage:             C  C  C
```

Columns 4..6 cannot be inherited. The frame must physically cover them:

```text
snapshot[f]        [a  b  c  d  e  f  g]
layer_above(f)     [a  b  c  d]
frame captures                 [e  f  g]
```

### A frame smaller than its layer above

```text
frame f saved_len = 3:       0  1  2
layer above length = 7:      0  1  2  3  4  5  6
```

Frame `f` says nothing about columns 3..6. They belong only to newer state and
vanish when restoring `f`.

## 4. Three representations of one logical frame

Suppose one live cell evolves as `A → B → C → D` after a mark.

```text
TRAIL                           HOT                     COLD
chronological writes           first old value         first old value
                                                        packed into a run

newest   ┌─────┐
         │  C  │  replay 1st
         ├─────┤
         │  B  │  replay 2nd      ┌─────┐              ┌───────────────┐
oldest   │  A  │  replay last     │  A  │              │ ... A ...     │
         └─────┘                   └─────┘              └───────────────┘
             │                         │                         │
             └─────────────── all restore A ────────────────────┘
```

Trail records `A, B, C`; reverse chronological replay applies `C`, then `B`,
then `A`. Hot stores only the first old value `A`. Persistent Hot frames are
unique but need not be sorted. Cold stores the same unique values grouped into
contiguous runs.

Trail→Hot deduplication first collapses every Trail column to its oldest value.
Hot→Cold then sorts the selected unique Hot frame **in place as a transient
translation step**. The sort is a permutation, so it preserves at-most-one entry
per index and the frame's index→value abstraction. Run construction consumes the
sorted order; sortedness is not a persistent `hot_repr_ok` invariant and must not
be required of ordinary Hot writes or restores. The representation-refinement
target is:

```text
base = resize_preserving_prefix(layer_above(f), saved_len(f))

reverse_replay(base, trail_frame)
    == apply(base, hot_frame)
    == apply(base, cold_frame)
    == snapshot[f]
```

The equations require the frame's coverage invariant. Any cells introduced
when extending `base` are physically covered, so their initial filler values
do not affect the result. Inherited cells retain the newer layer's values.

## 5. Restore order across tiers

To restore Hot frame `F₂` from the complete stack:

```text
CURRENT
   │
   ▼
resize once to saved_len(F₂) = 4, preserving the live prefix
   │
   ▼
replay F₅ Trail entries newest → oldest
   │
   ▼
replay F₄ Trail entries newest → oldest
   │
   ▼
apply F₃ Hot unique captures
   │
   ▼
apply F₂ Hot unique captures
   │
   ▼
snapshot[F₂] (length remains 4)
```

All replay writes are restricted to the fixed target-length window. Intermediate
rows need agree with their snapshots only within both that window and their own
saved domain; they need not materialize each intermediate snapshot in full.
When the target is longer than the initial live row, the coverage invariant
ensures the appropriate frames overwrite every newly introduced filler cell.

After replay, remove the target and newer frames. Preserve exactly the older
physical and canonical history prefixes, then rebuild capture state for the
surviving top frame. Clearing the entire canonical history is valid only for
restore to frame zero.

For an older Cold target, continue with direct Cold run copies. Trail order is
load-bearing because one column may contain multiple entries. Order within one
Hot or Cold frame is irrelevant because each index appears at most once.

### Connecting the induction to execution

Freeze the original container locally with `let ghost pre = *self`. Replay may
change the live buffer, but all frame lemmas continue to read `pre`, whose
invariant is still available. No second persistent frame history is needed:
`frame_saved_value` reads the existing pools and headers.

The diagram shows logical frame steps. Trail and Hot execution still use one
batched range per tier. `lemma_overlay_split` connects that range to the frame
induction, and `lemma_pair_tier_suffix_cell` follows inherited cells until it
finds a winning capture or reaches the original live row. Cold's checked run
composition feeds `lemma_physical_frame_step`; its reverse frame loop carries
the intersection with the fixed target window.

`reconstruct_target_checked` composes resize, capture preparation, and these
physical tier paths. Its contract establishes the target contents and preserves
all history fields. Final well-formedness is a separate obligation: truncate
history, retain the canonical prefix, promote a survivor when needed, and
rebuild capture state. Verification of reconstruction alone does not discharge
those later operations or the representation-conversion proofs.

## 6. Push and regrowth

Suppose the live vector is shorter than the newest frame's saved length:

```text
newest frame saved_len = 6

snapshot:  [a  b  c  d  e  f]
live:      [a  b  c]
captures:           [d  e  f]
                     3  4  5
```

Pushing at index 3 is regrowth, not a new transient cell:

```text
before push:
live:      [a  b  c]
capture:            d

after push(x):
live:      [a  b  c  x]
```

The frame captured `d` when index 3 was popped. Push therefore does not append
history. It restores the capture bit at index 3, keeps `d` authoritative, and a
later restore overwrites `x` with `d`.

The reusable induction lemma is a horizontal live-row extension:

```text
old live row: [  preserved prefix  ]
new live row: [  preserved prefix  ][new cells]

captured column   → independent of the live row
uncovered column  → already inside the preserved old prefix
```

In source this is `lemma_frame_inv_range_grow_layer`. It applies unchanged to
the authoritative Hot range and the canonical ghost `full_trail` range.

## 7. Proof obligations induced by the grid

The grid suggests the following reusable lemma families:

1. **Horizontal extension:** grow the live row while preserving its old prefix.
2. **Horizontal contraction:** before removing a saved column, ensure that the
   frame covers it; surviving uncovered columns remain in the retained prefix.
3. **Vertical frame locality:** changing the newest frame does not affect older
   frame ranges whose layer is a fixed snapshot.
4. **Frame delimiter preservation:** conversion may change representation but
   must preserve frame count, order, empty frames, and per-frame `saved_len`.
5. **Trail column fold:** reverse chronological entries in one `(frame,index)`
   column reduce to its oldest value.
6. **Trail-to-Hot refinement:** deduplication selects that same oldest value.
7. **Hot-to-Cold refinement:** sorted runs preserve the unique `(index,value)`
   map and therefore every covered column.
8. **Tier-partition depth:** Cold count + Hot count + Trail count equals logical
   snapshot depth; each segment maps its own saved lengths to the corresponding
   snapshots.

These lemmas avoid global length-order assumptions and align proof structure
with the actual physical layout.

## 8. Frame-size bounds from column geometry

The horizontal saved domain also yields representation-specific size theorems.
For frame `f`, every stored Hot or Cold payload names a column strictly below
`saved_len(f)`. Hot uniqueness and Cold run disjointness allow at most one
payload per column:

```text
hot_entry_count(f) <= saved_len(f) < I::max_nat()
cold_value_count(f) <= saved_len(f) < I::max_nat()
cold_run_count(f) <= cold_value_count(f)
```

Visually, Hot and Cold may occupy columns but cannot stack entries vertically:

```text
index:       0    1    2    3    4    5
Hot:        [A]       [C]            [F]     at most one box per column
Cold runs:  [A]       [C]            [F]     three singleton runs
             <--------- saved_len --------->
```

Trail has no analogous payload bound because repeated writes stack vertically
inside a column:

```text
index:       0    1    2
newest:          [D]
                  [C]
                  [B]
oldest:          [A]                       arbitrarily many writes at index 1
```

Trail-to-Hot `dedupe_first` establishes the bound. It maps every nonempty Trail
column to exactly its oldest recorded value, removes all newer duplicates, and
therefore produces at most one entry for each index below `saved_len(f)`:

```text
W = Trail write count        // may exceed saved_len
U = deduplicated index count // U <= saved_len
R = Cold run count           // R <= U
```

The formal proof should factor this into four named lemmas:

1. `stratum_unique` plus the per-entry index bound implies
   `hot_entry_count <= saved_len`;
2. Trail deduplication produces `stratum_unique`, preserves the first old value
   of every touched column, and implies `dedup_len <= saved_len`;
3. transient in-place sorting of a unique Hot frame preserves
   `stratum_unique` and the complete index→value frame abstraction; sortedness
   is only a local translation fact;
4. run formation over that transient sorted order produces disjoint Cold runs,
   preserves the same unique column map, and implies both
   `cold_value_count <= saved_len` and `cold_run_count <= cold_value_count`.

No proof may apply the Hot/Cold bound directly to an undeduplicated Trail frame.
That distinction is also the geometric basis of the adaptive ratios `W/U` and
`U/R`.
