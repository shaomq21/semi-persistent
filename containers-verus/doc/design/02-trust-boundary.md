# The Trust Boundary: What Is `external_body`, and Why

*The crate is verified with **no `admit`s and no `assume`s**. The only code the
verifier takes on trust is a small set of items marked
`#[verifier::external_body]` (their bodies are hidden; only their signatures /
`ensures` are believed) plus a small set of `broadcast axiom fn`s (four in the default build and five more behind
`literal-types`, plus an axiom for each consumer-defined ID type; see the
table below). This chapter enumerates exactly what is trusted and,
for each, why it is trusted rather than proved.*

*Counts, by configuration:*

| configuration | `external_body` markers | axiom fns |
|---|---|---|
| default features | **12** (2 opaque type registrations + 10 functions) | **4** (`builds_valid_hashers::<IndexHasher>`: SpMap's index hasher; mirrors vstd's shipped `RandomState` axiom; plus `obeys_key_model` for the `DenseId31`, `DenseId63` and `DenseUsize` index newtypes, §3.5 D-index) — `define_id*!` additionally emits one such axiom per consumer-defined id type |
| `literal-types` | **17** (adds 5 opaque type registrations) | **9** (adds `obeys_key_model` for BigInt, BigUint, CanonicalF64, CanonicalRational, BitsF64) |

*Counts re-derived by grepping `#[verifier::external_body]` and splitting
on the `literal-types` gate (`external_specs.rs` is the only gated
module); the CI gate (`.github/workflows/verus.yml`) pins them and fails
when doc and code counts diverge. Of the `ListArena` markers,
`tracking_bytes`/`total_bytes` are group B spec-free and
`data_capacity_bits` is group B contract-carrying (see §2c); only the
last is in the assumed-fact inventory.*

*The five markers in `bplus_layout.rs` are all group B
(contract-carrying), all there to make a **proved** fact reach the
machine code:*

- *`arr_get` / `arr_set`: fixed-size-array access with the bounds check elided.
  Trusted contract is `get_unchecked`'s own (`i < N` ⟹ in bounds), and `N` is the
  array's own const-generic length, so no arithmetic relates bound to index.
  Verus checks `i < N` at every call site; the check `rustc` would emit is
  provably dead, and eliding it is the point of having proved the bound.*
- *`sel_usize`: `if c { b } else { a }` via `core::hint::select_unpredictable`,
  so the bisection's data-dependent update lowers to `cmov` rather than a
  mispredicting branch (see [Chapter 10](10-bplus-tree.md)). The body is
  a total expression containing **no `unsafe`**; `select_unpredictable` is a
  codegen hint whose documented semantics are exactly the stated postcondition.
  It is `external_body` only because the intrinsic carries no Verus spec.*
- *`arr_shift_up`: opens a hole at `pos` by moving `a[pos..cnt]` up one slot.
  Verus can only carry a loop invariant through an explicit element loop, so the
  verified leaf/internal insert walked the tail down one word at a time where
  production issues one `memmove`. The four-clause postcondition (prefix, shifted
  window, tail, length) is the whole contract; `copy_within`'s own documented
  behaviour supplies it for the long arm, and the short arm is literally the loop
  it replaces. `pos <= cnt < N` is verified at every call site. **No `unsafe`.***
- *`slice_get`: the slice analogue of `arr_get`, for the one place the index bound
  is a runtime length rather than a const-generic one: the bulk loader reads its
  input `&[K]`, having proved `at + take <= keys.len()` and `j < take` in the
  enclosing invariant. Same trusted contract (`get_unchecked`'s own), and the
  emitted `cmp/jae panic` it removes was once per key in the loader's innermost
  loop (see [10-bplus-tree §5.2.4](10-bplus-tree.md)).*

*None of the five widens the assumed-fact inventory in a way a proof could
exploit: `arr_get`/`arr_set`/`slice_get` restate indexing that vstd already specs
for the checked form, `sel_usize` restates a conditional, and `arr_shift_up`
restates a slice copy whose effect its postcondition pins element-by-element.*

## Rules of the perimeter

These held for the whole proof drive and hold for every change inside
`verus!`:

- No `admit`, `assume` or `assume_specification` anywhere in the verified
  crates (a CI gate greps for them), and no contract-bearing `external_body`
  added to hide an obligation. The trusted count below is pinned in CI; a
  change that moves it updates this chapter and the pin in the same commit.
- Public contracts are never weakened to make a proof go through, and the
  public API stays total (the partial-API gate: no public function with a
  precondition beyond `wf`).
- `containers/`, the unverified implementation, is the differential and
  performance oracle and is not modified; every runtime property test and
  every paired benchmark compares against it as it was.
- Solver limits are not raised to admit a proof; a proof that exceeds them is
  restructured.

## 0. What `external_body` means

`#[verifier::external_body]` tells Verus: *do not look inside this function; take
its signature (and any `ensures`) as an axiom.* It is the mechanism by which
verified code meets the parts of the world the logic cannot describe: hardware
integer casts, process-global state, the allocator, opaque identity. It is more
localized and auditable than a free-standing `assume`/`admit`: an
`external_body` function has a typed interface whose callers are checked, and
where it carries an `ensures`, that contract is the only fact exposed. It is
not logically weaker magic; a false postcondition would still make the
verification unsound.

A healthy verified crate drives `external_body` down to the irreducible
boundary. The current final checkpoint has 12 default-build markers: 2 opaque
type registrations (the two hasher types, named in specs, no semantics assumed)
and 10 functions. They are, in full:

| Item | Why it is irreducible |
|---|---|
| `container_id::ContainerId::new` | mints an id by atomic increment; the counter is global mutable state |
| `hasher_spec::ExIndexHasher`, `ExFoldHasher` | external type specifications: they let the hasher types be NAMED in specs |
| `compression_config::env_compress_default`, `env_diff_store_kind` | read the environment from inside verified constructors; no spec content (every branch carries the same contract) |
| `vec::log_shrink_capacity`, `append_only_vec::shrink_aov_capacity`, `parallel_store::shrink_vec_capacity` | capacity-only shrink; vstd models neither `Vec::capacity` nor `shrink_to`, and the contract is "the view is unchanged" |
| `parallel_store::data_capacity_bits` | reads `Vec::capacity`, same gap, read-only |
| `std_sort::sort_pairs_by_index` | std's `sort_unstable_by_key` under its documented contract; vstd ships no sort specification |
| `guard::refuse` | the divergence every total refusal ends in; the panic machinery is unmodeled |
| `map::clone_key_exact` | vstd's hash-table key model requires the clone to be identical, which is not provable for a generic `K: Clone` |

Twenty-two items left this list on 2026-09-18, in two different ways, and the
distinction matters when reading the ledger.

**Twelve were stratified out of the perimeter** and are now neither proved nor
trusted, exactly as the byte reporters were (§2a): the ten
compression-statistics and shadow-logging functions, `list::white_box_head` and
`parallel::par_sum_canary`. Nothing verified calls them; they observe frames and
emit measurements.

**Ten were proved.** The five B+ tree node-layout primitives dropped their
`unsafe` bodies: `arr_get`, `slice_get` and `arr_set` now go through vstd's
specified array and slice accessors, `sel_usize` is an ordinary branch, and
`arr_shift_up` is a verified descending loop where a trusted `memmove` used to
be. Note honestly what moved where: the vstd accessors are themselves
`external_body` *in vstd*, so this crate stops trusting its own unchecked reads
and relies on the platform specification instead, and the bounds checks come
back. The measured price (2026-09-18, paired against the previous commit):
`bplus/from_sorted_only` 1.11–1.12, `bplus/scan_only` 1.08–1.10,
`bplus/from_sorted_then_scan` 1.06–1.07, every insertion, split and cursor case
at parity — the const-generic array checks fold away, the runtime-length slice
check in the bulk loader does not. All of those cases remain faster than the
unverified implementation in the same binary, so the parity rule is unaffected,
and the margin given back was ours.

`ContainerId` became transparent inside the crate (its field is `pub(crate)`, so
it stays opaque to consumers), which let its equality be proved and retired the
struct's own marker. `sparse_set::values_equal` now calls vstd's external trait
specification for `PartialEq`, whose `eq` promises `obeys_eq_spec() ==> r ==
eq_spec(..)`; this crate never establishes `obeys_eq_spec` for a caller's `T`,
so the result stays an unconstrained bool — which is what the scan wanted, now
without trust. `guard::check_precondition` diverges through `refuse` instead of
panicking itself. And `diff_compress::choose_mode` is verified end to end: its
statistics pass is two linear hash-set passes (vstd supplies the key model for
`usize`) with a deliberately trivial contract, since only sizes depend on the
counts.

The permanent groups below remain the
intended boundary; temporary three-tier Vec scaffolds are additionally owned by
`doc/tasks/three-tier-frame-architecture-goal.md` §8 and are removed milestone by
milestone. `d21-exec` HEAD `44b8657` had 94 default markers before the first
Hot-only proof milestone. That milestone added three parsing/runtime scaffolds
(`ExRatio`, `retained_closed_prefix`, and `hot_frame_run_count`) and removed the
pre-existing `Vec::with_store_policy` marker after proving policy construction,
for 96 default markers. H1 additionally proves the three-segment
`frame_saved_len_exec` dispatch and removes its marker. Retiring five unreachable
legacy scaffolds (`cold_pairs_scaffold`, `frame_sort_order`,
`cold_pools_shrink_scaffold`, `compress_all_hot`, and `restore_cold`) removes
five more markers, yielding H1 counts of 90 default and 95 with
`literal-types`. H2 verifies the public `Vec::push`, `Vec::pop`, and
`Vec::set_index` wrappers through checked Hot-scope dispatch and removes those
three markers, yielding H2 counts of 87 default and 92 with
`literal-types`. H3 verifies explicit Defer marks for both shrink variants and
removes the `push_frame_with_options` and `mark_with_options` markers, yielding
H3 counts of 85 default and 90 with `literal-types`. H4 removes the
public `restore_frame` marker and restricts the existing runtime restore marker
to `runtime_restore_frame_fallback`, whose precondition excludes the checked
all-Hot scope. This yields 84 default markers and 89 with `literal-types`.
The all-Hot dispatch includes Inline fused clearing and Parallel pre-clearing.
The Cold-run checkpoint removes the trusted default `restore_run` and its
`set_raw_usize_scaffold` helper. Inline now proves a clamped, tag-preserving
loop; DynStore dispatches to checked backend implementations. This yields
82 default markers and 87 with `literal-types`. The reconstruction checkpoint
then proves `runtime_begin_restore` after resizing and removes its marker,
yielding 81 default markers and 86 with `literal-types`. Its checked reconstruction
phase preserves all history fields and returns the target snapshot. Final
history truncation and survivor promotion remain in the trusted fallback.
The subsequent prefix checkpoint checks exact physical/canonical truncation
and completes zero-target restore for every tier layout. The remaining
`runtime_restore_frame_fallback` requires `target > 0`; its survivor promotion
and final invariant remain trusted at that checkpoint. Counts there remain 81 + 5.
The Cold-promotion checkpoint replaces that fallback with checked
`restore_cold_survivor_checked`, covering both Hot and Trail destinations, and
removes the now-unused trusted `runtime_promote_survivor`. Source decoding,
Cold-prefix preservation, destination representation, shared-map equality and
capture finalization are checked. Counts at that checkpoint are **79 default + 5 literal**;
axiom counts are unchanged. Remaining all-tier mutation/mark and rollover
scaffolds, plus derived/parallel composition obligations, are not discharged
by the restore result.
The canonical-capture checkpoint also checks the existing `push_frame` wrapper
against its dispatcher contract, removing its redundant marker: **78 default
+ 5 literal**. The dispatcher still depends on the recorded trusted all-tier
mark fallback; this does not discharge that implementation.
The physical-capture checkpoint checks `runtime_capture` for both ingress
disciplines, using actual DiffStore capture methods and preserving canonical
history. Its marker is removed: **77 default + 5 literal**. General set, pop,
push/regrowth and mark composition remain separate obligations.
The following set checkpoint checks `runtime_set_fallback` by composing capture
with the actual `set_raw` method. Pair, Cold and canonical preservation are
proved for mixed histories; untracked flag behavior retains its original
contract. Counts become **76 default + 5 literal**. Pop, push/regrowth and mark
remain separate implementation obligations.
The push/pop checkpoint discharges `runtime_push_fallback` and
`runtime_pop_fallback`, preserving all-tier reconstruction and capture state.
Trail regrowth restores its ghost membership through the existing store hook.
Counts become **74 default + 5 literal**; all-tier mark and policy execution
remain pending, as does complete production-interface instantiation.
No new trusted body was introduced. The
three-segment accessor, H1 extractor, Cold/ingress transfer lemmas, and
`maybe_shrink` pass targeted verification; a clean full Vec-module query reports
117 verified and 0 errors. The 1 + 5 feature-gated axiom counts are unchanged. The casts that were *eliminated* (the `IndexLike`/`DenseId` integer
casts) are described in §3.

The groups differ in kind, and the distinction is the point of this chapter:

- **Group A is trusted by *design*.** It models things that are external in
  reality: a process-global atomic and an intentionally-opaque identity. Even
  in principle we do not want to "prove" them; doing so would either be
  meaningless (no spec) or would expose an abstraction we deliberately keep
  closed. These are permanent.
- **Group B is trusted by *unmodeled std behavior*.** `Vec::capacity` /
  `shrink_to` / `size_of` have no vstd specs, and neither do `get_unchecked`
  or `select_unpredictable` (verified against vstd 0.0.0-2026-09-20-0158;
  that release added a `copy_within` spec, which no verified exec path here
  calls). The byte reporters are spec-free diagnostics; the
  shrink helpers, `data_capacity_bits`, and the five `bplus_layout` primitives
  carry contracts that restate the documented std behavior. Partly provable
  when vstd grows the specs; the
  [byte-accounting feature request](../future/verify-byte-accounting.md)
  scopes the reporter half.
- **Group C has two trusted runtime-trap primitives**. `check_precondition`
  carries a `requires` (so it is load-bearing in the proof, not spec-free);
  `refuse` diverges and has no post-state or contract to assume. Both are
  external only because their bodies use panic-formatting machinery the logic
  does not model. They are permanent and minimal.
- **Group D carries external key-model facts** (`clone_key_exact`, plus the
  feature-gated literal-type axioms in `external_specs.rs`). Trusted because
  the facts are about foreign deterministic value types.
- **Group E is unverified glue**: `values_equal`, the debug-only ring walk,
  `ListHead::white_box_head`, and the ordinary-Rust delegation shims outside
  `verus!{}`.

The Trail-dedupe checkpoint (2026-09-16) replaces the sort-based Trail
first-capture selection with a left-to-right fold through a
`HashSet<I, IndexHasher>` that writes each unique frame straight into the Hot
pool. Checking that path removes six markers: `runtime_migrate_trail_count`,
`runtime_migrate_trail`, `runtime_trail_shape`, `runtime_execute_trail_plan`,
the closure-based `retained_closed_prefix` (now a checked tier-indexed
function) and the opaque `ExRatio` registration (`Ratio` is now a Verus-native
struct whose `accepts` is proved). This yields 68 default markers and 73 with
`literal-types`. The membership set relies on vstd's shipped hash-table model:
`obeys_key_model::<I>()` (vstd axioms for the primitive widths; three crate
axioms for the id newtypes and one generated per `define_id*!` type, all over
structural `raw` equality, §3.5 D-index) and the existing
`axiom_index_hasher_builds_valid_hashers`. No sort contract is assumed on this
path any more.

The Hot-to-Cold checkpoint (2026-09-16) sorts each closed Hot frame in place
in the Hot pool with std's unstable sort and encodes it straight from that slice,
replacing the per-frame `to_vec` copies, the adaptive `Vec<Vec<(T, I)>>` Hot plan
and the run-count scratch vector. The sort is the one new trusted item,
`std_sort::sort_pairs_by_index` (group B, contract-carrying: std's documented
`sort_unstable_by_key` behaviour, same multiset and non-decreasing key order,
nothing outside the slice touched). Checking the migration removes five markers
(`runtime_migrate_hot_count`, `runtime_migrate_hot`, `runtime_hot_shape`,
`runtime_execute_hot_plan`, `hot_frame_run_count`), for 64 default markers and
69 with `literal-types`. `diff_compress::sort_frame_by_index` now sorts its copy
with the same contract instead of the former verified insertion sort, whose
quadratic worst case was a runtime hazard; the contract of that function is
unchanged.

The policy-dispatch checkpoint (2026-09-16) checks the whole rollover dispatch
above the migrations: `runtime_closed_history_bytes` (checked arithmetic with
`guard::refuse` on overflow), `runtime_reclaim_adaptive_tier_capacities` (now a
checked `shrink_vec_capacity` composition, so its former contract-free row 10a is
retired), `runtime_apply_adaptive` and the public `apply_adaptive`,
`runtime_apply_tier_policy` and the public `apply_tier_policy`, `flush_trail`,
`compress_hot`, `runtime_apply_configured_rollover`, `runtime_rollover_on_mark`
and the `ApplyConfigured`/`ForceClosed` mark path `runtime_push_frame_fallback`.
Eleven markers are removed with no new trusted item, for 53 default markers and
58 with `literal-types`. The remaining `Vec` markers are the byte reporters and
diagnostics (`diff_log_len`, `tracking_bytes`, `total_bytes`,
`log_heap_bytes`, `log_shrink_capacity`) and the
transparent policy-type registrations.

The pending-indices checkpoint (2026-09-16) checks the read-only consumer
helper `pending_restore_indices` and replaces its `external_body` Cold scaffold
with the checked `pending_cold_indices_checked`/`pending_pair_indices_checked`
passes. Its contract now states exactly which indices it names: `Some` iff the
token is restorable, and an index is named iff some frame at or above the
token's frame captures it (`frame_captures`, the physical saved-value lookup).
Two markers are removed with no new trusted item, for 51 default markers and 56
with `literal-types`. The same checkpoint adds the checked production sequence
witness `sequence_witness_checked` (Step 3).

The final checkpoint of that campaign removed the last execution-first `Vec`
marker, `try_mark_adaptive` (the entry point itself is gone since 2026-09-18,
when the columns lost their token API; its structural twin is
`try_push_frame_adaptive`): the public "mark, then one adaptive pass" entry had
kept a trusted semantic postcondition (view unchanged, depth + 1, snapshot
pushed) after every function it calls became checked. Its body is unchanged —
the three guards, the checked `mark_with_options` and the checked
`runtime_apply_adaptive` — and the contract now follows from theirs. One
marker removed, no new trusted item: **50 default markers and 55 with
`literal-types`** (the ledger reached **12 and 17** on 2026-09-18; see the counts
table at the top and §2d) at that checkpoint (49 and 54 since the total public API
removed the debug-only ring walk). Every remaining default marker is itemized in §4 or in the
frame-architecture ledger's diagnostics rows; none carries a semantic
postcondition about container contents.

## 1. Group A: `ContainerId` (trusted by design), 3 items

`ContainerId` is the per-container identity used to reject a `restore` token
minted by a *different* container (`vec.rs` / `append_only_vec.rs`:
`token.container_id.id() == self.id.id()` inside `is_token_valid_spec`). It is
three trusted items.

### 1a. `struct ContainerId`: opaque identity

```rust
#[verifier::external_body]
pub struct ContainerId { raw: u64 }
//   pub uninterp spec fn id(self) -> nat;
```

(The runtime payload widened from production's `u32` to `u64` to increase
wraparound headroom.) The struct is `external_body` so its `raw`
field is invisible to the verifier;
the only thing specs may say about a `ContainerId` is its abstract
`id(): nat`, declared **`uninterp`** (uninterpreted, deliberately given no
definition). **Why not proved:** there is no theorem here; a struct has no
contract. This is a *modeling choice*: we want identity to be abstract so that
no proof can accidentally depend on the concrete representation. Making
`raw` visible would buy nothing and couple proofs to the bit pattern.

### 1b. `ContainerId::new`: process-global atomic

```rust
#[verifier::external_body]
pub fn new() -> ContainerId {
    static NEXT: AtomicU64 = AtomicU64::new(1);
    ContainerId { raw: next_id_from(&NEXT) }   // plain fetch_add, u64-wide
}
```

The allocator is a **plain `AtomicU64::fetch_add`** (`next_id_from`, outside
`verus!{}`): production's algorithm widened from `AtomicU32` to `u64`. Default
release builds can wrap after 2^64 allocations; that width makes collision
impractical for ordinary executions but is not a non-wrapping guarantee.
`strict-id-exhaustion` makes exhaustion fatal, and debug builds assert the
boundary. Exhaustion is unit-tested by parking a counter at that boundary
(`container_id.rs` in-module tests). The strict-feature performance tradeoff
must be evaluated with the maintained Criterion conformance benchmark; this
chapter makes no fixed timing or percentage claim. **Why not proved:** it
reads and mutates a **process-global `AtomicU64`**, a
side effect on mutable global state that lives entirely outside Verus's ghost
world. The functional logic reasons about pure transformations of tracked state;
a `static` atomic counter is, by construction, not tracked state. There is also
**no `ensures`** to discharge: the property one would want ("each call yields a
fresh id") is a *stateful temporal* fact about the global counter, which this
signature cannot even express. To make distinctness *provable* one would replace
the atomic with a `tracked` ghost monotone counter threaded as a linear resource
through every constructor (the upgrade sketched in
[Ch. 3 §5](03-fork-history.md)), but (i) the atomic read itself would remain
external regardless, and (ii) **nothing in the crate consumes distinctness** (see
§1d). So the upgrade proves an unused property at the cost of rippling the entire
construction API. We keep the lean encoding by deliberate decision.

### 1c. `ContainerId::eq`: the one trusted axiom

```rust
#[verifier::external_body]
pub fn eq(self, other: ContainerId) -> (b: bool)
    ensures b == (self.id() == other.id())
{ self.raw == other.raw }
```

This one *has* a contract, and it is the single load-bearing axiom in Group A:
"the runtime `==` on the hidden `raw` reflects ghost-`id()` equality." **Why not
proved:** the body compares `self.raw == other.raw`; the `ensures` speaks of
`self.id() == other.id()`. Bridging them requires knowing `id()` is a function of
`raw`, but `id()` is `uninterp` *on purpose* (§1a). So `eq` *axiomatizes* the
bridge. We could make it provable by defining `id(self) == self.raw as nat`, but
that re-exposes the representation §1a intentionally hides. The axiom is
minimal, local, and is exactly what the cross-container guard relies on.

### 1d. Why Group A is sound to trust

The container check is **not on the correctness-critical path.** The headline
`restore` theorem (`view() == snapshots[token.depth]`) and all of branch-cut
safety ([Ch. 3](03-fork-history.md)) hold *without* it; the container id only
*rejects cross-container misuse*, a caller error. Concretely, no proof consumes
`new()`'s distinctness; `is_token_valid_spec` only needs the *equality
reflection* of §1c, which holds by construction for a token a container minted
from itself. That axiom proves that the executable check agrees with the
abstract equality used by contracts; it does not prove that separately
allocated containers have distinct identities. Global freshness remains an
environmental assumption, with finite runtime evidence from
`container_id_new_is_distinct` and `cross_container_token_rejected` in
[`tests/external_body_contract_fuzz.rs`](../../tests/external_body_contract_fuzz.rs)
mint thousands of ids and check end-to-end that one container rejects another's
token.

## 2. Group B: unmodeled std behavior, 8 items

Verus/vstd model a `Vec`'s element sequence (`@`) but not its **allocation**:
`capacity()`, `shrink_to`, and `size_of::<T>()` have no specs. Everything that
reads or manages capacity is therefore `external_body`. The B+tree hot-path
primitives (§2d) are the same kind of trust over three other unspecced std
operations (`get_unchecked`, `select_unpredictable`, `copy_within`). Four
sub-kinds, the first of which is now empty:

### 2a. Byte reporters: stratified out of the perimeter (was 12 items)

The byte reporters (`Vec::{tracking_bytes, total_bytes, diff_log_len}`,
`log_heap_bytes`, `ListArena::{tracking_bytes, total_bytes}`, and the
`heap_bytes` of `CaptureBits`, `CompressedStack`, `Codes`, `GenStamps`,
`InlineStore`, `ParallelStore`, plus the ones of `TrailStore`, `DynStore`,
`TwoStackLog`, `CircularList`, `History`) are read-only diagnostics that no
proof reads and that cannot alter execution. Since 2026-09-17 they are plain
Rust outside every `verus!` block: a `diagnostics::HeapBytes` trait (exported
as `HeapBytes`) carries `heap_bytes` for the stores and columns, and each
container's reporters live in an ordinary `impl` block after its verified
one. They are therefore neither verified nor trust markers — Verus does not
see them — and `DiffStore` no longer has a `heap_bytes` method (consumers
bound `S: HeapBytes` where they need the number). The production-parity
checks below still run against them unchanged. What follows is the record of
what they were while they carried markers.

Production parity: all report the capacity-based allocation
footprint using exactly production's formulas.

```rust
// vec.rs
#[verifier::external_body]
pub fn tracking_bytes(&self) -> usize {
    self.diff_log.capacity() * size_of::<(T, I)>()
        + self.frames.capacity() * size_of::<Frame<I>>()
        + self.forks.heap_bytes()
}
#[verifier::external_body]
pub fn total_bytes(&self) -> usize {
    size_of::<Self>() + self.store.heap_bytes() + self.tracking_bytes()
}
// fork_history.rs
#[verifier::external_body]
pub fn heap_bytes(&self) -> usize { self.origins.capacity() * size_of::<ForkOrigin>() }
// capture_bits.rs
#[verifier::external_body]
pub fn heap_bytes(&self) -> usize { self.words.capacity() * size_of::<u64>() }
// parallel_store.rs (DiffStore impl)
#[verifier::external_body]
fn heap_bytes(&self) -> usize {
    self.data.capacity() * size_of::<T>() + self.captured.heap_bytes()
}
// inline_store.rs (DiffStore impl)
#[verifier::external_body]
fn heap_bytes(&self) -> usize { self.data.capacity() * size_of::<T::Repr>() }
// list.rs (ListArena; added by the InlineStore port) — sums the two inner vecs
#[verifier::external_body]
pub fn tracking_bytes(&self) -> usize {
    self.heads.tracking_bytes() + self.nodes.tracking_bytes()
}
#[verifier::external_body]
pub fn total_bytes(&self) -> usize {
    self.heads.total_bytes() + self.nodes.total_bytes()
}
```

The two `ListArena` reporters are `external_body` only because the `+` would
otherwise carry an overflow obligation that is not proof content (a real footprint
never approaches `usize::MAX`) and because they forward to already-external
reporters. They are the production side of the arena memory-parity assertion:
`containers-conformance/tests/list_arena_differential.rs` compares them against
production's identical pair, `tracking_bytes` byte-for-byte and `total_bytes` up
to the constant 16-byte `u64`-`ContainerId` delta, at any size and mark depth.

**Why not proved (today):** `capacity()` and `size_of` are unspecified in
vstd, and the functions carry **no `ensures`**: they are diagnostic
instrumentation no proof reads. **Partially provable in principle** (a ghost
byte model with saturating arithmetic; the
[byte-accounting feature request](../future/verify-byte-accounting.md) scopes
it), but the capacity read itself stays external until vstd models it.
Runtime validation: the differential trace `differential_bytes`
(`containers-conformance/tests/differential.rs`) checks `tracking_bytes` agrees **exactly** with
production over randomized push/set/pop/mark/restore traces (identical
element layouts + deterministic std::Vec growth make exactness meaningful
there), and `total_bytes` respects a lower-bound floor (struct + tracking +
data). The store-side reporters (`ParallelStore`/`InlineStore`/
`CaptureBits::heap_bytes`) are NOT compared exactly against production:
the u64 `ContainerId` and word-at-a-time CaptureBits growth intentionally
differ from production's representation, so only the formula shape is
parity, not the number. The smoke test `byte_counters_are_consistent`
(external_body_contract_fuzz.rs) checks total ≥ tracking, monotonicity,
no panic.

### 2b. Capacity-shrink helpers (contract-carrying), 2 items

```rust
// parallel_store.rs — shared by InlineStore::shrink_if
#[verifier::external_body]
pub(crate) fn shrink_vec_capacity<T>(data: &mut Vec<T>, factor: usize, headroom: usize)
    ensures data@ == old(data)@,
{ if data.capacity() > factor.saturating_mul(data.len()) { data.shrink_to(headroom.saturating_mul(data.len())); } }

// append_only_vec.rs — production's AppendOnlyVec variant
// (condition cap > len*factor + headroom, target len + headroom)
#[verifier::external_body]
fn shrink_aov_capacity<T>(data: &mut Vec<T>, factor: usize, headroom: usize)
    ensures data@ == old(data)@,
```

**Why not proved:** `Vec::capacity`/`shrink_to` are unmodeled. The trusted
contract is exactly "the element sequence is unchanged", the std-documented
behavior of `shrink_to`. Provable when vstd specs capacity ops. Runtime
validation: `shrink_preserves_vec_contents` / `shrink_preserves_aov_contents`
(external_body_contract_fuzz.rs) drive both helpers through the public
`mark(ShrinkPolicy::IfOverallocated)` surface across random contents,
overallocation levels, and `(factor, headroom)` policies, asserting the
element sequence is unchanged, so every contract-carrying trusted item in
the crate now has a contract-level runtime test.

### 2c. `data_capacity_bits` (contract-carrying), 1 item

```rust
// parallel_store.rs
#[verifier::external_body]
pub(crate) fn data_capacity_bits<T>(data: &Vec<T>) -> (n: usize)
    ensures n >= data@.len(),
{ data.capacity() }
```

**Why not proved:** `Vec::capacity()` is unmodeled, exactly as in §2b. **Why it
is load-bearing rather than diagnostic:** the `ensures n >= data@.len()` is what
makes capture-word truncation invisible to `captured()`: every flag a caller can
still observe sits at an index below `len <= capacity`, so dropping the words
above capacity cannot change any observable answer. A proof reads this contract;
it is not instrumentation.

The trusted statement is the std-guaranteed `Vec` invariant `capacity() >= len()`,
which is about as safe as an unmodeled-capacity assumption gets: it is weaker
than §2b's, since it asserts an inequality rather than preservation of contents.
Provable when vstd specs capacity ops.

### 2d. Bounds-elided array/slice primitives (contract-carrying), 5 items (`bplus_layout.rs`)

`arr_get`, `arr_set`, `slice_get`, `sel_usize`, `arr_shift_up` were added by the
B+tree hot-path work so that facts Verus already **proved** at the call sites
reach the machine code: the elided bounds check (`i < N` is a verified
precondition, so the `cmp/jae panic` `rustc` emits is provably dead), the
`cmov` lowering of the bisection's data-dependent update, and one `memmove`
where Verus's invariant rules force an element loop. The per-item argument,
including why each contract adds nothing a proof could exploit, is in this
file's preamble and in each function's own doc comment; the performance each
one pays for is in [10-bplus-tree](10-bplus-tree.md).

**Why not proved:** `get_unchecked`, `select_unpredictable`, and `copy_within`
have no vstd specs (checked against the pinned vstd). Each contract restates
the operation's documented behavior: checked indexing for
`arr_get`/`arr_set`/`slice_get`, the replaced `if`/`else` for `sel_usize`,
`copy_within(pos..cnt, pos+1)` stated element-wise for `arr_shift_up`.
Provable when vstd specs those operations. The verified alternatives have
different generated-code shapes; the Criterion B+tree workloads, not a fixed
historical percentage, determine whether those shapes remain worthwhile.
Runtime validation is two-layered: hand-rolled agreement fuzzes in
`external_body_contract_fuzz.rs`, and the property suite
`src/bplus_layout_tests.rs`, which checks each contract against its
checked std form with shrinking, at the `(T, N)` instantiations the trees use,
including both sides of `arr_shift_up`'s length-18 scalar/`memmove` dispatch
at every admissible `pos`.

## 2.5. Group C: the runtime-guard primitives (`check_precondition`, `refuse`), 2 items

`refuse(msg) -> !` is the total-operation shell's panic arm: a public
total function branches on its would-be precondition and calls `refuse` in
the violating arm, so the signature carries no obligation. `external_body`
for the same reason as `check_precondition` (unmodeled panic machinery);
contract-free in the strongest sense: the `!` return type means there is no
post-state to assume anything about.


```rust
#[verifier::external_body]
pub fn check_precondition(cond: bool, msg: &str)
    requires cond,
{
    if !cond { panic!("containers-verus: precondition violated: {}", msg); }
}
```

This one item (`guard.rs`) carries a `requires cond` and is **load-bearing**:
public methods whose preconditions a non-Verus caller could violate by silent
integer wrap (e.g. `restore` past the `u32` fork-history limit, `push`/`add`
past the index type, `insert` past `usize`) call it at entry. A *verified*
caller discharges `cond` from the method's own `requires`, so the branch is
provably dead for them and behavior is unchanged; an *unverified* caller who
violates the precondition gets a descriptive panic instead of corruption.

**Why not proved:** the body's `panic!` uses the format machinery Verus does not
model (`core::panicking::panic_fmt` has no spec). This is exactly why `vstd`'s
own `runtime_assert` is `external_body` too. The `requires cond` *is* checked at
every call site, so the trusted part is only "the body panics when `!cond`",
which is a one-line `if`. Nothing algorithmic hides here. (See
[Ch. 3 §5](03-fork-history.md) for the generation-counter limit these guards
protect.)

### 2d addendum: the node-layout primitives are proved (2026-09-18)

The five `bplus_layout` primitives no longer carry markers. Three of them
(`arr_get`, `arr_set`, `slice_get`) now go through vstd's specified array and
slice accessors, which is a genuine reduction in *this* crate's trusted base —
the `unsafe` unchecked reads are gone — but an honest reader should note the
trust moved to the platform's specification rather than disappearing, since those
vstd accessors are `external_body` in vstd. `sel_usize` is the branch its
contract always described, and `arr_shift_up` is a verified loop where a trusted
`memmove` used to be.

Rust's bounds checks come back with them. Measured against the previous commit
(`bplus_cursor_bitset_bench`, two runs, τ = 1.08): insertion, split and cursor
cases at parity, because those index the const-generic `data` array and the
compare folds away; `bplus/scan_only` 1.08–1.10, `from_sorted_then_scan`
1.06–1.07 and `from_sorted_only` 1.11–1.12, because the bulk loader and leaf
scan read a slice whose length is a runtime value. All of them remain faster than
the unverified implementation in the same binary. One trusted hint helper
(`requires cond`, body `core::hint::assert_unchecked(cond)`) would restore the
margin for a thirteenth marker; it was declined. The numbers and that option are
recorded in `doc/tasks/final-performance-report.md`.

## 3. The integer casts are proved, not trusted

The `IndexLike::as_usize` / `try_from_usize` casts on the primitive integers
(`u8`/`u16`/`u32`/`u64`/`usize`) and the `DenseId::as_usize` casts carry
value-preserving `ensures` and verify; none is `external_body`:

- `u8`/`u16`/`u32` widening (and the guarded narrowings of `try_from_usize`)
  verify directly; Verus models these casts.
- `u64` and `DenseId63` (a `u64` payload) rely on the cast being the value
  identity on a 64-bit host: `usize::MAX == u64::MAX`. This is discharged by
  `index_like::lemma_u64_usize_64bit` over the crate-wide `global size_of
  usize == 8` pin, and the whole `u64`/`usize` index path is
  `#[cfg(target_pointer_width = "64")]`-gated, so verifying them adds no new
  assumption beyond the target pin.

The governing principle is that "wraps a cast" is not the same
as "must be trusted". A cast with a value-preserving `ensures` is provable
once the host-width fact is pinned; only genuine side effects (§1b),
intentional abstraction (§1a/§1c), and spec-free plumbing (§2) are the real
boundary.

## 3.5. Groups D and E: consumer-facing trusted surfaces

Consumer integration adds two trusted surfaces of a different kind,
enumerated here so the ledger stays complete.

### Group D: external key-model facts

**`clone_key_exact` (map.rs, `external_body`, contract-carrying):**

```rust
#[verifier::external_body]
fn clone_key_exact<K: Clone>(key: &K) -> (r: K)
    requires obeys_key_model::<K>(),
    ensures r == *key,
{ key.clone() }
```

This carries requirement (3) of vstd's hash-table key model ("the executable
`Key::clone` produces a result identical to its input"), which `SpMap` already
assumes for every key type via `obeys_key_model::<K>()` (`new`'s
precondition, threaded through `wf`). vstd states that requirement in prose on
the `uninterp obeys_key_model` and provides no lemma projecting it out, so
this helper carries it as its contract. **No NEW assumption** beyond what
`obeys_key_model` already asserts.

**Feature `literal-types` (`src/external_specs.rs`):**
five `broadcast axiom fn`s (mirroring vstd's own primitive-type key-model
axioms) giving `obeys_key_model::<T>()` for `num_bigint::BigInt`,
`num_bigint::BigUint`, and the three crate-local canonical wrappers
`CanonicalF64`, `CanonicalRational`, and `BitsF64`
(`src/canonical_keys.rs`), plus five opaque
`external_type_specification` registrations required to name the types in
specs (contract-free: they count as `external_body` markers but assume no
semantics).

The credibility argument is NOT mere determinism: vstd's requirement (2)
demands `==` classes be singletons up to value identity. For BigInt/BigUint
the exec `eq` is STRUCTURAL (digit-vector + sign comparison) over the
crate's normalization invariant (no trailing zero limbs, `NoSign` iff zero,
`debug_assert!`ed in the impls themselves), so structural equality of a
canonical representation is value identity; the assumption reduces to
"num-bigint maintains its own documented invariant".

**Withdrawn (would have been FALSE):** `BigRational` and
`OrderedFloat<f64>` do NOT obey the key model and get no axiom.
`OrderedFloat`'s `eq` puts all NaN bit patterns (and ±0.0) in one `==`
class; `Ratio::new_raw` makes non-reduced values reachable and `eq` is
mathematical comparison, so raw `2/4 == 1/2` across distinct
representations. Both violate requirement (2) outright. Regression tests
in `tests/compat_map.rs::key_model_violations` DEMONSTRATE each violation
so the exclusions stay justified against future crate upgrades.

**Replacements:** the crate-local canonical wrappers (`canonical_keys.rs`)
restore float/rational keying with requirement (2) TRUE BY CONSTRUCTION:
`CanonicalF64` is a `struct { bits: u64 }` whose only constructor folds all
NaNs to one encoding and −0.0 to +0.0, with derived `Eq`/`Hash` over the
single field (its `==` IS bit identity; no foreign code participates in
its equality at all); `CanonicalRational` holds a reduced,
positive-denominator `BigInt` pair produced only via `Ratio::new`, so one
representation per rational is reachable and derived structural equality
is value identity (resting on the same normalized-`BigInt` argument as the
BigInt axiom). Their axioms remain axioms only because `obeys_key_model`
is `uninterp`: nothing can be proved to satisfy it, not even a type where
the property holds by construction.

**The forcing function for future key types:**
`declare_key_model_assumption!` (exported from `external_specs.rs`). A
verified consumer introducing a new key type cannot discharge `SpMap::new`'s
`requires obeys_key_model::<K>()` without an axiom (the predicate is
`uninterp`); the macro makes that unavoidable act disciplined: it pins the
`axiom_key_model_` name prefix (compile-time checked, CI-greppable),
requires a justification string embedded in the generated docs, and
generates a requirement-level fuzz test (hash determinism, clone identity,
and `==`-iff-representation-identity over a caller-supplied generator and
representation observable, the exact failure mode that sank the withdrawn
axioms). Exercised end-to-end in `tests/key_model_macro.rs`.

Feature-gated: `cargo verus verify` passes with and without
`literal-types` (both **1703 verified, 0 errors** as of 2026-08-24; the axioms
add obligations only to their users, so the two
configurations agree fact-for-fact). Runtime validation (`tests/compat_map.rs::literal_keys`): an
SpMap-vs-HashMap oracle trace, **plus fuzz tests of the key-model
requirements themselves**: eq-coherence across construction paths with
representation-agreement checks (requirement 2's falsifiable observable),
hash determinism (1), clone identity (3). The oracle trace alone cannot
detect an identity/`==` mismatch (both maps use the same `Eq`/`Hash`);
the requirement-level fuzzing is what tests the assumed facts.

**D-hasher: `axiom_index_hasher_builds_valid_hashers`
(src/hasher_spec.rs, default build; 1 axiom + the `ExIndexHasher` and
`ExFoldHasher` registrations).** `SpMap`'s transient key index is
`std::collections::HashMap<K, I, S>` for a hasher parameter `S: ValidHasher`
(2026-09-20): a trait asking for `Default` and a proof of
`builds_valid_hashers::<S>()`, with two impls, each on an axiom that already
ships — `IndexHasher`, the default, on this one, and `std::hash::RandomState`
on vstd's own. Choosing a hasher adds no trusted item. The rest of this entry
describes the default. `IndexHasher` is an
8-byte crate-local `BuildHasher` carrying an explicit seed and delegating to
foldhash's `fast` family, the same hash ALGORITHM production's `Map` uses
(hashbrown 0.17's `DefaultHashBuilder` is a newtype wrapping
`foldhash::fast::RandomState`). vstd models `std::HashMap<K, V, S>`
generically over any `S: BuildHasher` (gated on `builds_valid_hashers::<S>()`),
and ships exactly one instance of that predicate: an `admit()`ed axiom for
std's `RandomState`. This axiom is its mirror image: same shape, same strength,
and a *weaker* assumption, since `IndexHasher` stores its seed by value at
construction, making `build_hasher` a pure function of that seed. Owning the
type is also what makes the seed configurable (`SP_HASHER_SEED`,
`set_default_seed`, `IndexHasher::with_seed`) with no added trust: the seed
rides in `Default`, which is the constructor vstd already specs generically
over `S: Default` (vstd does not spec `HashMap::with_hasher`).
`builds_valid_hashers` asserts only that the hasher is byte-deterministic
(output depends solely on the `Hash`-fed bytes), NOT collision-freedom or
any distribution property, neither of which a HashMap's correctness needs.
`IndexHasher` is an ordinary seeded-then-deterministic `BuildHasher`, exactly
like std's `RandomState`; they differ only in the hash function, which the model
does not observe. Under `hasher-random-seed` the entropy is drawn once when the
process default is resolved, never per `build_hasher` call. In the default
build the fallback is the constant `DEFAULT_SEED`, but `SP_HASHER_SEED` and
`set_default_seed` may replace it. Each constructed `IndexHasher` is
deterministic for its stored seed. Process-wide reproducibility additionally
requires configuring the seed during single-threaded startup, before any
container construction, and treating `SeedSealed` as fatal: a concurrent
setter can lose a race after an earlier hasher observed the old seed.
**No proof can conclude `builds_valid_hashers` for ANY hasher** (the predicate
is `uninterp`), so vstd admits it for `RandomState` and we admit the identical
fact for `IndexHasher`. This is the whole
cost of closing the former SpMap performance exception. Unconditional (not
`literal-types`-gated) because the
index is core to `SpMap`.

### Group E: unverified glue, 2 `external_body` items + ordinary-Rust shims

**`external_body` members:**

| Item | Contract | Why trusted |
|---|---|---|
| `values_equal<T: PartialEq>` (sparse_set.rs) | NONE: result is an unconstrained bool, so nothing unsound is derivable; `remove_value` promises the structural change, not which value matched | avoids threading vstd's `obeys_eq_spec` plumbing; scan behavior pinned by ported production proptests |
| `ListHead::white_box_head` (list.rs) | NONE: read-only test accessor with no `ensures` | unpacks the runtime niche for white-box differential tests; no proof depends on its result |

**Ordinary-Rust items outside `verus!{}`** that delegate 1:1 to a verified
core; the trusted content is exactly "the delegation line calls the verified
method with the converted argument":

| Item | Delegates to | Why outside the proof |
|---|---|---|
| `Vec::get(impl Into<I>)` (vec.rs, bottom) | verified `get_index` | generic `Into` carries no Verus-visible input/output relation |
| `Vec::set(impl Into<I>, T)` | verified `set_index` | same |
| std `Iterator` impls for `VecViewIter` / `ListIter` | verified inherent `next` | trait impls for unmodeled std traits (each is one delegation line) |
| `white_box_*` read accessors (bplus.rs, list.rs, circular_list.rs) | immutable field borrows | `#[doc(hidden)]` oracle access for runtime property tests; read-only, cannot violate any invariant |
| `next_id_from` (container_id.rs) | (atomic allocator) | the trusted allocator behind Group A's `new`; plain wrapping `fetch_add` over `u64`, optional fatal boundary behind `strict-id-exhaustion`, exhaustion unit-tested |
| consumer `Tagged` impls + macro expansions in egraph | verified witness instantiations | consumer crate is not run under Verus. Mitigated by the canary's shape fixtures; the per-type contract fuzzers this row assumes do **not** exist yet |

Every safety property behind the glue (bounds panics, capture protocol,
snapshot fidelity) is enforced by the verified core it calls; the glue cannot
bypass it.

The e-graph consumer has a separate ordinary-Rust proof-processing boundary:
proof-forest path reversal, the naive explanation walk, Euler-tour LCA table
construction/query, deep explanation expansion, and proof serialization are
tested executable algorithms, not Verus theorems. Verified columns and
mark/restore invariants protect their storage, but do not prove forest
acyclicity or explanation correctness. See
[`egraph-class-layer.md`](egraph-class-layer.md) and the retained proof-forest
verification task in
[`../future/conformance-and-release.md`](../future/conformance-and-release.md).

## 3.6. Group F: the diff-compression campaign's additions, 19 items

The compression, shared-fork-history and parallel-mark work has added 19
markers at this point. 17 carry no `ensures` and so cannot corrupt a
proof; 2 carry contracts.

### 3.6a. Diagnostics and shadow instrumentation (no `ensures`), 12 items

`frame_stats` (compression_stats.rs), `mode_name` (compression_stats.rs), `observe` (compression_stats.rs), `observe_frame` (compression_stats.rs), `run_count_sorted` (compression_stats.rs), `run_count_writeorder` (compression_stats.rs), `shadow_emit` (compression_stats.rs), `shadow_enabled` (compression_stats.rs), `shadow_log_copy` (compression_stats.rs), `shadow_log_full` (compression_stats.rs), `cold_frame_count` (diff_log.rs), `shadow_key` (diff_log.rs).

None carries an `ensures`, so no proof can depend on them and a wrong body
yields a wrong diagnostic rather than an unsound theorem. They are external for
three separate reasons: `frame_stats`, `run_count_sorted` and
`run_count_writeorder` use `HashSet` and `sort_unstable`, which Verus does not
model; the `shadow_*` family does file and stderr I/O behind a `OnceLock`; and
`shadow_key` is `self as *const _ as usize`, raw pointer identity. `mode_name`
and `cold_frame_count` are pure matches and are recorded as dischargeable
rather than necessary.

### 3.6b. Environment levers (no `ensures`), 2 items

`env_compress_default` (compression_config.rs), `env_diff_store_kind` (compression_config.rs).

`std::env` has no Verus model. These are sound to trust rather than merely
unavoidable, because every value each lever selects carries the same verified
contract: the stores are separately proved to refine one model, so the flag
chooses between representations that are already interchangeable.

### 3.6c. Mode selection (no `ensures`), 1 items

`choose_mode` (diff_compress.rs).

The decision arithmetic is verified in `FrameStats::best_mode`. The marker
covers only the `size_of` and the `HashSet` the wrapper threads through on its
way there.

### 3.6d–3.6f. The dyn group's trusted items: all gone (2026-09-18)

These three subsections described trusted items that belonged to the predecessor
dyn group (`sync_group.rs`, `Vec<Box<dyn SyncMember>>`): the parallel
`mark_parallel`/`restore_parallel` twins, the group `checksum` declared on the
member trait, and the rayon canary. That module is deleted, and with it those
markers — three fewer, which is where 37 became 34 before the wider audit took
the ledger to 12.

The parallel fan-out itself did not disappear, it moved and changed status. The
e-graph's `EGraphMembers` and the anti-unification layer's `AuMembers` are
borrowed forwarding views implementing `group::Member`; above a threshold their
exec parts fan the structural operation out over a `rayon::scope` on disjoint
`&mut` borrows. Both live in unverified consumer crates, so they are glue rather
than trusted twins of verified functions: nothing assumes a postcondition about
them, and the group's contract is discharged by the members' own `Member`
contracts on the sequential path. What was genuinely trusted before — "rayon
applies the closure to each member exactly once" — is now confined to code Verus
never reads, and the differential test pinning parallel against sequential is
still the evidence that the split is right.

The canary (`parallel::par_sum_canary`) is likewise no longer a marker: it is
plain Rust below its module's `verus!` block, confirming at runtime that the
rayon backend links.

## 4. Summary table

The table below catalogs the permanent and historically grouped trust items.
The complete current source count is **12 default-build `external_body`
markers plus 4 default-build axioms** (the twelve byte reporters of rows
4–9 and 11a–11b are outside the perimeter since 2026-09-17, §2a) (plus one generated `obeys_key_model`
axiom per `define_id*!` id type in consumer crates); execution-first three-tier Vec markers not
itemized here are enumerated in
`doc/tasks/three-tier-frame-architecture-goal.md` §8. The `literal-types`
additions are listed after the table.

| # | Item | Group | Trusted because | Provable? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ~~`struct ContainerId`~~ | A | **no longer a marker**: transparent in-crate since 2026-09-18 — the field is `pub(crate)` and `id()` reads it, so the type stays opaque to consumers while the projection is a definition | n/a |
| 2 | `ContainerId::new` (+ `next_id_from` allocator) | A | process-global atomic side effect; no `ensures`; wrapping `u64` allocation with an optional fatal boundary | no (side effect) |
| 3 | ~~`ContainerId::eq`~~ | A | **no longer a marker**: proved 2026-09-18 — with `id()` transparent, `self.raw == other.raw` discharges `b == (self.id() == other.id())` | done |
| 4–9 | byte reporters (`Vec::tracking_bytes`, `Vec::total_bytes`, `ForkHistory::heap_bytes`, `CaptureBits::heap_bytes`, `ParallelStore::heap_bytes`, `InlineStore::heap_bytes`) | — | **no longer markers**: plain Rust outside `verus!` since 2026-09-17 (§2a); read-only diagnostics | n/a (outside the perimeter) |
| 10 | `shrink_vec_capacity` | B | `Vec::capacity`/`shrink_to` unmodeled; contract = element sequence unchanged (std-documented) | when vstd specs capacity ops |
| 10b | `std_sort::sort_pairs_by_index` | B | std `<[T]>::sort_unstable_by_key` is unmodeled by vstd; contract = documented behaviour (permutation of the slice in non-decreasing key order, nothing else touched); consumed by Hot-to-Cold migration and `diff_compress::sort_frame_by_index` | when vstd specs slice sorting |
| 11 | `shrink_aov_capacity` | B | same (AppendOnlyVec variant formula) | same |
| 11a–11b | `ListArena::tracking_bytes`, `ListArena::total_bytes` | — | **no longer markers**: plain Rust outside `verus!` since 2026-09-17 (§2a) | n/a (outside the perimeter) |
| 11c | `data_capacity_bits` | B | `Vec::capacity` unmodeled; **contract-carrying**: `n >= len` is what makes capture-word truncation unobservable (§2c) | when vstd specs capacity ops |
| 11d | ~~`arr_get`~~ (bplus_layout) | B | **no longer a marker**: 2026-09-18 it became `*vstd::array::array_index_get(a, i)`. The `unsafe` read is gone; what remains is vstd's own specified accessor, so the trust moved to the platform and Rust's bounds check returns (cost: §2d) | done, modulo vstd |
| 11e | ~~`arr_set`~~ (bplus_layout) | B | **no longer a marker**: `a[i] = v` under vstd's array-update specification, same trade as 11d | done, modulo vstd |
| 11f | ~~`slice_get`~~ (bplus_layout) | B | **no longer a marker**: `*vstd::slice::slice_index_get(s, i)`. This is the one whose bound is a runtime length, so its check does **not** fold away — the measured cost lives here (§2d) | done, modulo vstd |
| 11g | ~~`sel_usize`~~ (bplus_layout) | B | **no longer a marker**: proved 2026-09-18 as the plain `if c { b } else { a }` its contract always described; the `select_unpredictable` codegen hint is dropped | done |
| 11h | ~~`arr_shift_up`~~ (bplus_layout) | B | **no longer a marker**: proved 2026-09-18 as a verified descending loop carrying the four-clause postcondition; the trusted `copy_within` arm is gone, and a node's window is bounded by its arity so the loop is short by construction | done |
| 11i | `guard::refuse` | C | diverges (`-> !`); body is the unmodeled panic machinery; nothing assumable (no post-state) | n/a (no contract) |
| 12 | ~~`guard::check_precondition`~~ | C | **no longer a marker**: proved 2026-09-18 — the violating arm diverges through `refuse` (row 11i), whose `!` return leaves no post-state obligation, so the runtime monitor survives without trusting this function | done; the panic itself is row 11i

| 18 | `ExFoldHasher` registration | D | same: names foldhash's `FoldHasher` (`IndexHasher`'s associated `Hasher` type) so the `BuildHasher` impl type-checks under Verus | n/a (no contract) |

`literal-types` additions (all in `external_specs.rs` / `canonical_keys.rs`):

(`canonical_keys.rs` itself is plain unverified Rust (group E in kind), but
its entire behavioral surface is pinned by the requirement-level proptest
fuzz in `tests/compat_map.rs::canonical_key_model`.)

Plus the Group E ordinary-Rust delegation shims tabulated in §3.5.

**Bottom line (permanent grouped subset).** Default build: 3 trusted-by-design `ContainerId` items
(permanent; equality reflection trusted, global freshness not proved, and
finite distinctness behavior runtime-fuzzed), 11 capacity-introspection items
(8 spec-free byte reporters
(production-formula parity; `tracking_bytes` differential-tested exactly,
store reporters formula-level only), 2 contract-carrying shrink
helpers, and `data_capacity_bits`), 5 bounds-elided array/slice primitives
(§2d: each contract restates a documented std behavior, fuzzed and
property-tested against the checked form), 2 runtime-trap primitives (`check_precondition`, load-bearing,
body is a one-line panic; `refuse`, diverging and contract-free), 1 key-model projection (`clone_key_exact`, no
new assumption beyond the `obeys_key_model` precondition SpMap already
carries), 3 glue items (`values_equal` unconstrained, the debug
ring-walk diagnostic, and the contract-free `white_box_head` accessor), and
1 hasher fact + its 2 type registrations
(`axiom_index_hasher_builds_valid_hashers` + `ExIndexHasher`/`ExFoldHasher`:
mirrors vstd's shipped `RandomState` axiom so SpMap's index can use
production's hash algorithm with a configurable, deterministic-by-default seed;
§3.5 D-hasher). With `literal-types`: +5 contract-free type
registrations and +5 `obeys_key_model` axioms: BigInt/BigUint (foreign,
structural-eq argument), CanonicalF64/CanonicalRational (crate-local
wrappers replacing the WITHDRAWN-as-false BigRational/OrderedFloat axioms;
requirement (2) by construction, violation regressions pin the
exclusions), and BitsF64 (raw-bit injective, the long-term float key;
CanonicalF64's fold is a pinned production-parity decision, see
key-model-tcb.md §float-semantics). Future key types must go through
`declare_key_model_assumption!` (justified + auto-fuzzed axioms). Default build
also carries the D-index `obeys_key_model` axioms for `DenseId31`,
`DenseId63`, `DenseUsize` and each `define_id*!` id type (structural `raw`
equality and hashing under the clean-id type invariant), consumed by
`IndexLike::lemma_obeys_key_model` so Trail deduplication can key its
membership set by the index type without widening. The permanent-boundary subset includes `ContainerId::eq`'s equality
reflection, the two shrink helpers' data preservation,
`data_capacity_bits`'s `capacity >= len`, `clone_key_exact`'s clone identity,
and the five `bplus_layout` primitives' agreement with their checked std
forms. The execution-first Vec contracts are additional temporary assumed
facts and are tracked function-by-function in the three-tier task ledger; they
must not be described as proved until their checked cores replace the outer
markers. No `assume`/`admit` occurs in project sources. The first Hot-only
milestone added checked capture/set/mark/restore cores. H1 removes the
`frame_saved_len_exec` marker after a checked three-segment body, establishes
the general-wf-to-Hot bridge, and restores a green full Vec-module gate without
adding a trust marker. H2 checks canonical and physical Hot push/pop/set,
proves Hot-scope dispatch cannot reach non-Hot fallbacks, and removes the public
`push`, `pop`, and `set_index` markers. H3 proves explicit Hot `Defer` marks
for `Never` and thresholded shrink through checked dispatch and removes the
`push_frame_with_options` and `mark_with_options` markers.

**Scope note.** "No `assume`/`admit`" is a claim about *this crate's project
sources*. The sibling `abstract-domains` crate likewise has a project-local
source gate and its ordinary verification run discharges 994 conditions. Its
pinned `vstd` contains admitted specifications, so global `--no-cheating`
fails in that dependency; this is an explicit dependency trust boundary, not a
project theorem. Nothing in `containers-verus` depends on
`abstract-domains`, so their trust statements remain independent. The future
design for shrinking this crate's boundary, including eliminating the key-model
axioms via canonical key types, is `doc/future/key-model-tcb.md`.
