//! Semi-persistent map backed by [`AppendOnlyVec`] + a transient hash index.
//!
//! The append-only log `(K, V)` is the source of truth; semi-persistence
//! (mark/restore) lives entirely in that already-verified log. A `HashMap`
//! accelerates key lookup, mapping each key to the dense log index of its MOST
//! RECENT entry. On `restore` the index is unwound over the entries about to
//! be discarded, newest first, so the work is proportional to the truncated
//! suffix, not to the survivors, and no surviving key is cloned. When the
//! suffix outnumbers the survivors the full rebuild (`rebuild_index`) is
//! cheaper and is used instead.
//!
//! The map has two key disciplines, chosen by the `UNIQUE` parameter:
//!
//! * **Last-write-wins** (`UNIQUE = false`, the default and the published
//!   semantics): an insert of a present key appends a new entry and the older
//!   one lingers in the log as a shadow. Each log position then also records
//!   the PREVIOUS occurrence of its key (`prev`, a parallel column filled from
//!   the value `HashMap::insert` hands back), which is what lets the unwind
//!   point a key back at its earlier occurrence instead of dropping it.
//! * **Unique keys** (`UNIQUE = true`, [`SpUniqueMap`]): no key occurs twice in
//!   the log. `try_insert` refuses a present key with `DuplicateKey`, and
//!   `try_intern` returns the existing entry. The previous-occurrence column
//!   is not kept — every link would be `None` — so an insert is one log push
//!   and one hash, and the unwind is a bare removal per discarded entry. Every
//!   interning table in the e-graph is one of these.
//!
//! Verified invariant (`wf`): the exec index agrees with `is_last_occurrence`,
//! the declarative "this position is the latest one holding its key", over the
//! current log; and the discipline's own column invariant holds — `prev`
//! agrees with `is_last_occurrence_prefix` (the same statement cut at the
//! entry's own position) under last-write-wins, or the log's keys are pairwise
//! distinct (`keys_unique`) under unique keys. From that, `get_by_key`/
//! `contains_key` provably read the latest value, and `restore` provably
//! returns the map to its marked logical contents (the log headline theorem
//! composes through). `unwind_index` and `rebuild_index` each re-establish
//! the agreement after a restore.
//!
//! Keys are `K: Clone + Hash + Eq` (production parity — String/Vec keys work).
//! The one clone-spec fact needed is the key model's own requirement (3):
//! `Key::clone` produces a result identical to its input (see
//! `clone_key_exact`).
//!
//! The index's `BuildHasher` is the `S` parameter, any [`ValidHasher`]: a
//! hasher that is `Default` and provably valid in vstd's model, each on one
//! already-shipped axiom. The default, [`crate::hasher_spec::IndexHasher`], uses
//! the same hash ALGORITHM production gets from hashbrown 0.17's default;
//! `std::hash::RandomState` (SipHash, per-process random keys) is the choice
//! for keys from an untrusted source. The rest of this note is about the default. Its
//! seed is DETERMINISTIC by default (a fixed constant, so runs are reproducible)
//! and CONTROLLABLE three ways — `SP_HASHER_SEED`,
//! `hasher_spec::set_default_seed`, or `IndexHasher::with_seed` per instance.
//! The `hasher-random-seed` feature changes only what the seed defaults to.
//! Not literally production's type — hashbrown's `DefaultHashBuilder` is a
//! newtype wrapping `foldhash::fast::RandomState` and forwarding every `write_*`
//! to it.
//!
//! Note the seed is invisible to this map's OBSERVABLE behaviour either way:
//! the log is the source of truth, `iter()` walks it in insertion order,
//! `rebuild_index` replays it in insertion order, `unwind_index` walks it in
//! reverse position order, and the index is never iterated (lookup-only).
//! Fixing the seed makes the internal layout and probe
//! sequences reproducible too. See `hasher_spec` for the full policy.
//!
//! vstd models `std::HashMap<K, V, S>` generically over any `S: BuildHasher`,
//! so every hasher gives the same verified container; the one
//! `builds_valid_hashers::<S>()` fact each operation needs comes from the
//! hasher's `ValidHasher::lemma_builds_valid_hashers` — this crate's
//! `axiom_index_hasher_builds_valid_hashers` for the default, vstd's shipped
//! `RandomState` axiom for std's.
