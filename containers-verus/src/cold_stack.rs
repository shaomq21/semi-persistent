//! `ColdStack<T, I>`: the pooled cold tier of the tiered diff design
//! (doc/tasks/restore-from-compressed-frames-goal.md §3).
//!
//! A LIFO stack of sealed frames whose storage is bump-allocated out of shared
//! pools: pushing a frame appends to each pool, popping truncates each pool to
//! the header's recorded offsets. Fragmentation cannot occur and a frame costs
//! zero allocations. Runs are CSR: run `i` of a frame occupies
//! `values[offs[i] .. offs[i+1]]` and lands at `target[starts[i] ..]`, so the
//! end and the length are derived, not stored.
//!
//! Offsets, not slices: a `&[T]` into a sibling pool is self-referential and
//! unsound regardless of the borrow checker, because a pool `push` may
//! reallocate. Integer offsets are half a fat pointer's size, keep the
//! structure relocatable, and stay inside the verifiable subset.
//!
//! The restore contract (§4) is deliberately NOT implemented here yet: this
//! file is the layout and its invariants. Direct cold restore lands with the
//! extensionality lemma in the next step, and until then nothing constructs a
//! `ColdStack` on a live path.
